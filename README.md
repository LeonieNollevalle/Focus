<br>

Proudly presents: Focus, this app.<br>
It was born from 4 individuals, the 18th of October, 2021.<br>
It came as the second project for our training at Wild Code School (Nantes, Fr).<br>
Why `Focus` ? Simply a direct reference to camera's lenses<br>
This app provides functionalities such as: browsing libraries, bookmarking movies/series, advanced search and more...

## ![Concept](https://i.imgur.com/VAtnKbo.png)
<br>

How to get away from the principle of giant streaming platforms like
Netflix or Youtube? How would it be, as viewers, to NOT be overwhelmed
by tons of suggestions all around. How would it be to **no longer consume**
cinema as the mass product it became ? What would be a local movie
theater, in a digital shape, with only a few cinematographic works to
discover ?

<br>
